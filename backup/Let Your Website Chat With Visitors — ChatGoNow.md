**April 18, 2026 – San Diego, California** — In the competitive world of e-commerce, small businesses are constantly searching for tools to improve customer engagement and boost conversions. One such business, **OceanTrail Outdoor Gear**, discovered a game-changing solution with **ChatGoNow**, the all-in-one live chat plugin that lets your website chat with visitors in real time.

## Before Using ChatGoNow

For years, OceanTrail struggled with low engagement. Visitors browsed products but rarely made purchases. Their website looked great, but it couldn’t *talk* to customers — questions went unanswered, and leads went cold. The company’s conversion rate hovered around **1.8%**, far below the industry average.
